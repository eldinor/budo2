the cli adds glslify and shader-reloader/transform by default, but the exported server doesnt

fix that.

hmm, so this should really be a default transform added to budo instead of adding budo to this

the programs reference a cli , but they arent actually a cli app. they are just node-launchable apps that listen to stdin

this is good though, because it provides an opportunity to merge cli args using subarg format from a config file
